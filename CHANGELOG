CHANGELOG



11.09.2014
Nutaq2GASPware - n2g - First working version. Writing only in GASPware format. 


04.10.2014
New "Format" option in config. Format = {gasp, list, stats}


08.10.2014
Added Calibrations, same as for Grain.
New "Fold" option in config. (coincidence level)
read_grain.h: Storing only data from ADCs defined in config file -> huge speed improvement


20.10.2014
New error messages when reading the config file -> almost "idiot proof"
Changed maxnum to maxnum[dettype] to optimize speed and fix a possible bug in 'event_builder.h'
List mode output is more complex, added timestamp difference, customizable in the config file
This is the final C version of the code.


24.10.2014
The code is compiled via 'make', using g++. ROOT must be installed.
Added root option Format = {gasp, list, stats, root}
Tree Branches are defined in the config file -> each detector type is a branch (the same as for event lists)
The event builder used is 'event_builder_tree.h' -> check comments inside it for more details
Added percentages and remaining time in write_time.hh
"Memoryuse" is not needed anymore (set to default 100.000)
Fixed 'tref'-reference is kept even in different files of the same run.
Added comments column in the config file.
Fixed "parameter = 0" bug in GASPware output.


27.10.2014
ROOT file contains also histograms with singles ("define_root.hh")
"event_builder_tree.hh" -> HRT not relative to the event mean any more. 
The first signal in the event has timestamp zero 
E_Reference contains the time till the next reference. Energy is useless. 
Comments in the config file are the branches names.


10.11.2014
Starting this GitHub thing. New name: Nutaq4IDS - n4i
"calibrate.hh" - Fix random number bug (observed only in OSX)


14.11.2014
In correlation mode: fixed some bugs
RunStart and RunStop not required any more in the config file

13.08.2015
Modified the event builder (require new config and .setup files). Same .setup files can be used
  - Removed the old GASP header (difference between proton pulses) -> now the code is faster
  - Run time is defined in the header (GASP), LRT is defined as before only if reftype > 0
  - Both references are included (proton and run start) for both GASP and ROOT
In correlation mode the unit is always 10ns (1 digitizer unit)
Adding new format: rate (reading only the last buffer and displaying stats for it) - the input file is set as the second argument (argv[2])

16.08.2015
The ROOT Tree has arrays as branches
The 'rate' mode will also write a ROOT file containing the last part of the file

20.08.2015
Fixed various memory bugs due to the new ROOT leafs (damn ROOT). Now everything works, as much as I know of.

30.08.2015
Changed ROOT branch naming (removed empty spaces) and defined the TIMESTAMP as a
ULong64_t

11.09.2015
Fixed ROOT Memory leak causing it to crash when converting huge files. (just lowered memoryuse)
read_config.hh - ntmc can store more values for the same signal (good for veto)

21.10.2015
Fix in the Makefile:
Thanks to https://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=18344
Changed $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $(OBJECTS) -o $@ into $(CC) -o $@ $(OBJECTS) $(LDFLAGS)

11.05.2016
Fixed the "old block at the beginning of file" problem, now it reads the first
timestamp from the second block.

10.02.2017
The first buffer is skipped completely (is from the old RUN).

09.01.2019
Increased the maximum number of detectors of the same type from 30 to 70.
