 
Setup your local Git profile - In the terminal:
Type git config --global user.name "your-name"
Type git config --global user.email "your-email"

To check if Git is already config-ed you can type git config --list


git init - This initializes a git repository in your project
git status


TO PUSH:
git add . - This adds in all of your files & changes so far to a staging area.
git commit -m "first commit" - This commits all of your files, adding the message “first commit”
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/project - This creates a remote, or connection, named “origin” pointing at the GitHub repository you just created.
git push -u origin master - This sends your commits in your “master” branch to GitHub




If you want to continue making changes and pushing them to GitHub you’ll just need to use the following three commands:

git add .
git commit -m "type your commit message here"
git push origin master
