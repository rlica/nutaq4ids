\begin{abstract}
\noindent The ISOLDE Decay Station recently commissioned at CERN uses the Nutaq data acquisition system similar to the one used in JYFL.The $C/C++$ code \emph{'nutaq4ids'} is an event builder easily configurable through an user accessible text file as argument. It is able to convert  list-mode raw data into ROOT and GASPware event format and also provides some tools for monitoring. \\

\noindent The code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/rlica/nutaq4ids.
