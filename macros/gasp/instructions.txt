I am attaching two macros which might be useful (hoping you do not have them already)
1- convert 1d root histo into ascii file readable by xtrackn
2- convert 2d root hist into cmat format

usage of first: run root
call routine by .L roottoascii_xtsp.C
then        roottoascii_xtsp((TH1F*) h)

the second needs to be modified and compiled

Ciao
